### Methods to show progress:
If you want to show you are still working or done, add the following:  
🚧- Construction emoji, means you are still working on this section  
✅- Done with this task
❌- red "x", means you are not done, have not started, or are in progress
📝- This is a note to others. You can assign these notes to all or to a specific person.  
❎- If you see a note 📝 assigned to you or if you are going to accept it, replace it with a ❎  

### Notes to Writers:
📝 - Suggest a better title for this document  
📝 - Just so you know, I'm (STEAM Clown) an going to be just editing this doc in place, so if you make a fork, just make sure you check it in correctly
🚧- I'm going to add a lab template, where we can each pick a lab and update that section.

# Verilog Hackathon Education Kit Manual
## About This Manual  
🚧- ❎- STEAM Clown will update this later  
This Manual and labs are a comprehensive introduction to Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL), designed for both beginners and experienced engineers looking to deepen their understanding of digital system design. Whether you're new to Verilog or aiming to strengthen your skills, this course offers a solid foundation in modeling, simulating, and synthesizing digital logic. You’ll learn how to describe complex hardware systems using Verilog, with hands-on experience targeting both FPGA and ASIC platforms.   

Through progressive modules, real-world labs, and capstone projects, you'll gain practical skills applicable to embedded systems, electronics engineering, and chip design industries. This course balances conceptual understanding with industry-relevant application, making it ideal for students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.  

This Verilog Manual will walk you through a set of Labs and Exercises that will quickly let you see the results of your Verilog code implemented in hardware.  You will learn through hands on labs, that will take you from simple Verilog syntax to more complex structures. The Lessons will explain the code, and the Labs will provide challenges implementing the concepts from the Lessons. This Tutorial will not go very deep into Simulation or Testbenches.  The goal is to teach basic Verilog syntax, and quickly see its implementation in the kit Hardware.  

While the Verilog design flows described in this Manual can target multiple FPGAs boards & ASIC tools flows, most design flows described in this manual,  will target the Gowin Sipeed Tang Nano 9K FPGA Development Board (GOWIN GW1NR-9)  


## Introduction - Verilog Hackathon Education Kit

## Introduction to The Verilog Language & Syntax
🚧- This section will gove a overivew of the Verilog language, and have a few sections on the Verilog syntax, but not have labs.  Some topics and sections are as follows:  
### Introduction to Digital Design and Verilog  

### ASIC vs FPGA: What’s the Difference?  

### Verilog Design Flow Overview (Simulation, Synthesis, Implementation)  

## Introduction To Kit Hardware  
### Gowin FPGA Board - Tang-Nano Introduction  
#### 🛠️ LAB Activity: Install of the Gowin Tang-Nano FPGA tools - Installation & Build Steps  
🚧- ❎- STEAM Clown will update this later
In this 🛠️ Lab Activity, you are going to install the Gowan Tang-Nano FPGA tools.  You will verify that the installation is correct and ready to run the subsequent Verilog Labs. 

### Gowin FPGA Board - Tang-Nano Setup & Hardware Connections    
🚧- This section will show the connection of all the harware, GPIO baoard, Display, Utrasonie, etc...

## Verilog Labs
📝 - The following are the Labs that are in the [Basic Music - Hackation](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/tree/main) in the [Problems](https://github.com/yuri-panchul/basics-graphics-music/tree/main/hackathon/problems) directory.  What other labs should we have to teach basic Verilog.  
📝 - STEAM CLown - I think that we should have a few more Labs to show using the GPIO board.  Also, maybe we should cheage the order of the labs, so we can do all the labs focused on the GPIO module befre we start looking at the Dislay. Thoughts?  

### Gates & Muxes

### Rectangles & Circles

### D Flip Flop

### Binary Counter

### Shift Register

### Moving Rectangle

### Game Example

### Ultrasonic Distance

### Rotary Encoder
