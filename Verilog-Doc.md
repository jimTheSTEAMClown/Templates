### Methods to show progress:
If you want to show you are still working or done, add the following:  
🚧- Construction emoji, means you are still working on this section  
✅- Done with this task
❌- red "x", means you are not done, have not started, or are in progress
📝- This is a note to others. You can assign these notes to all or to a specific person.  
❎- If you see a note 📝 assigned to you or if you are going to accept it, replace it with a ❎  

### Notes to Writers:
📝 - Suggest a better title for this document  
📝 - Just so you know, I'm (STEAM Clown) an going to be just editing this doc in place, so if you make a fork, just make sure you check it in correctly
🚧- I'm going to add a lab template, where we can each pick a lab and update that section.
